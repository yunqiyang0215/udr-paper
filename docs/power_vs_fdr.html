Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.
</p>
<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version <a href="https://github.com/yunqiyang0215/udr-paper/tree/95f897fec4f09f1925b86909ad71743c53a331d4" target="_blank">95f897f</a>. See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:
</p>
<pre><code>
Ignored files:
    Ignored:    .DS_Store
    Ignored:    .Rhistory
    Ignored:    .Rproj.user/
    Ignored:    analysis/power_vs_fdr_cache/

Unstaged changes:
    Modified:   analysis/test_tpr_code.Rmd

</code></pre>
<p>
Note that any generated files, e.g. HTML, png, CSS, etc., are not included in this status report because it is ok for generated content to have uncommitted changes.

These are the previous versions of the repository in which changes were made to the R Markdown (<code>analysis/power_vs_fdr.Rmd</code>) and HTML (<code>docs/power_vs_fdr.html</code>) files.

<strong>Warning:</strong> The above code chunk cached its results, but it won’t be re-run if previous chunks it depends on are updated. If you need to use caching, it is highly recommended to also set <code>knitr::opts_chunk$set(autodep = TRUE)</code> at the top of the file (in a chunk that is not cached). Alternatively, you can customize the option <code>dependson</code> for each individual chunk that is cached. Using either <code>autodep</code> or <code>dependson</code> will remove this warning.

<strong>Warning:</strong> The above code chunk cached its results, but it won’t be re-run if previous chunks it depends on are updated. If you need to use caching, it is highly recommended to also set <code>knitr::opts_chunk$set(autodep = TRUE)</code> at the top of the file (in a chunk that is not cached). Alternatively, you can customize the option <code>dependson</code> for each individual chunk that is cached. Using either <code>autodep</code> or <code>dependson</code> will remove this warning. See the <a href="https://yihui.name/knitr/options/#cache"

<strong>Warning:</strong> The above code chunk cached its results, but it won’t be re-run if previous chunks it depends on are updated. If you need to use caching, it is highly recommended to also set <code>knitr::opts_chunk$set(autodep = TRUE)</code> at the top of the file (in a chunk that is not cached). Alternatively, you can customize the option <code>dependson</code> for each individual chunk that is cached. Using either <code>autodep</code> or <code>dependson</code> will remove this warning. See the <a href="https://yihui.name/knitr/options/#cache"

<!-- Adjust MathJax settings so that all math formulae are shown using
TeX fonts only; see
http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/configuration.html.  This will make
the presentation more consistent at the cost of the webpage sometimes
taking slightly longer to load. Note that this only works because the
footer is added to webpages before the MathJax javascript. -->
